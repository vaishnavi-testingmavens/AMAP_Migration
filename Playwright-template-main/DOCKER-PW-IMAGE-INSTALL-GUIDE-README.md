ðŸ“¦ Instructions to Extract and Use the Playwright Framework via Docker
Follow these steps to extract the Playwright automation framework from the Docker image and use it on your machine.

âœ… Step 1: Create a Folder
Create a folder at your desired location to store the Playwright framework. For example:

bash

mkdir playwright-framework
cd playwright-framework

On Windows, you can do this using File Explorer or via Command Prompt / PowerShell.

âœ… Step 2: Place the Docker Image File
Move the file tm-playwright-template.tar.gz into the folder you just created.

âœ… Step 3: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt / PowerShell (Windows).

Navigate into the folder you created:

bash

cd path/to/your/folder


âœ… Step 4: Decompress the Docker Image File
If you're on macOS or Linux:
bash

gzip -d tm-playwright-template.tar.gz

If you're on Windows:
Right-click the file and extract it using 7-Zip or WinRAR.

This will give you a file called: tm-playwright-template.tar

âœ… Step 5: Load the Docker Image
Once extracted, run the following command to load the Docker image:

bash

docker load -i tm-playwright-template.tar

âœ… Step 6: Run the Docker Container to Export the Framework
Make sure you are inside the same folder where you placed the .tar file, and then run:

On macOS / Linux:
bash

docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/export" tm-playwright-template

On Windows (PowerShell):
powershell

docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/export" tm-playwright-template


ðŸŽ‰ Done!
The framework will now be extracted directly into the folder you created. You can now open it in your code editor
